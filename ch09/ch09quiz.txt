Quiz answers for chapter 09


1. Given an int variable x and an unsigned int variable y, as well as x = 0x8765
and y = 0x8765, and if the leftmost bit is used as a sign bit, is x equal to y?

Answer: 
No, they are not equal since the binary representation: 
0b1000 0111 0110 0101
Shows that the leftmost bit is occupied in 0x8765
Therefore, the unsigned variable y = 0x8765 would yield 34661 
while the signed variable x = 0x8765 yields -30875.


2. What should you do if you try to assign a large value to an int variable, but the
value you assign is too large and you end up with a negative number that you
didn’t expect?

Answer:
You should convert the variable to a unsigned type, but with the consequence 
that you can't store negative values in the variable anymore.


3. Which format specifier, %ld or %lu, should be used to specify an unsigned long
int variable?

Answer:
For specifying (unsigned long), you would use the %lu specifier.
The other specifier %ld is for (signed long int)


4. What is the name of the header file you have to include if you’re calling some C
math functions from your C program?

Answer:
The name of the header file containing math functions is "math.h"
