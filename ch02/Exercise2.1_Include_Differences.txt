Is #include <stdio.h> the same as #include “stdio.h”?

Answer: 
No. The angle brackets (< and >) in the #include <stdio.h> expression ask the C
preprocessor to look for a header file in a directory other than the current one. On
the other hand, the #include “stdio.h” expression tells the C preprocessor to
check the current directory first for the header file stdio.h, and then look for the
header file in another directory.
